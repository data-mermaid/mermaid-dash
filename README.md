MERMAID Global Dashboard. A read-only platform that summarizes all the information collected through the datamermaid application. You can read more about [datamermaid here](https://datamermaid.org/).

MERMAID Global Dashboard uses Create-React-App for its build tooling.

## Setup

If you've been onboarded, or have worked with a Node-based project that uses NPM or Yarn, you will be in a comfortable, familiar space. If not, we suggest that you take some time to brush up on how Node works, and how you can use it to build new projects through tutorials such as (but not limited to) [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.htm). We also suggest that you be familiar with how to use [git](https://try.github.io/).

### Base Requirements
A .env file is required in the root, with these vars defined:
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
REACT_APP_MERMAID_API_URL=

#### Node

To set up a local environment for this platform, you need to install Node JS, with the Dubnium LTS. You can install it through [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you want to be able to work with more than one version of Node on your local computer for other projects, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Git

In order to contribute to this project, you will also need to have a command-line terminal and Git.

### Install Node Dependencies

Once you've installed Node, you should fork this repo, then clone locally. Once cloned, you can install all of the dependencies using the `npm install` command.

### Run/Test

You can run the application using `npm start`. To run the existing tests, run `npm run test`.
