# How to Contribute

Thanks for reading this. We love having external collaborators!

## Testing

If you're submitting changes, consider writing a test or two?

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

If you want to learn more about the zen of commit messages, [this article by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) has been an _excellent_ guide to our work, wherever we go.
